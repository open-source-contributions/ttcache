**2.0.2**
- fixes a bug where a cache repository exception would prevent from re-computing the data

**2.0.1**
- fixes a bug with Memcached TTLs

**2.0.0**
- Introduction of wrapped returns. Calls to `->remember` now return a `Result` class which wraps the value and some additional information such as the tags applied to that value and whether it was computed or retrieved from the cache.
- **deprecation**: The return directives `GetTaggedValue` and `GetTaggedValueInterface` have been removed. They are no longer necessary with the introduction of wrapped results and the `Result` class.
- **deprecation**: Calling `->load` now returns an instance of `LoadResult` and not `Result`.

**1.0.3**
- `ShardingTag` no longer use the reserve char `:`
- fixes issue when no tags are used.

**1.0.2**
- use `md5` as default hasher instead of identity (sane prod default)
- avoid `:` character in keys for Redis compatibility
- add compatibility for PSR-6 implementations that return an `iterator` where we previously only supported an `array`

**1.0.1**

- fixes issue with cache implementations that always populate keys in `getMulti` even for cases where the value was not found and set the value to `NULL`.
- `$ttl=null` now means `forever`

**1.0.0**
